<that>Pineapples should be approached with caution</that>
<template>

<li>Pineapples first appeared on the earth 1.8 million years ago. Though the pineapple prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from insects and small rodents to deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most citrus, the pineapple is territorial and largely solitary, although there is some overlap in home ranges. Sorry, I was thinking 
about bobcats.</li>
<li>The Pineapple hunts animals of different sizes, and will adjust its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents, squirrels, birds, fish and insects, it will hunt in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand and wait for victims to wander close.

Alternate fishsticks and bananas on a bed of cooked spaghetti. Use cream of tomato soup instead of spaghetti sauce. Add one can of of wax beans and one can of fruit cocktail in heavy syrup. Top with cornmeal and Velveeta.
Bake at 350 degrees for one hour. An old Holiday favorite that's perfect for family get togethers!
