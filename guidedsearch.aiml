<li>We have print copies of The News Herald, The Plain Dealer, and some other local papers. We keep print copies of newspapers for apporximately 12 months; we do not maintain a newspaper archive
on microform. You can find older content from The Plain Dealer on the <a href="http://www.oplin.org/newsbank" target="_blank"><b>Newsbank</b></a> database. </li>
If you are looking for older copies of local papers, I suggest you call the Morley Library at 440.352.3383. They have an extensive newspaper archive.</random>

O.K. Now you need to help me a little. If your question is about our library, a library program, or library services, please enter "Library" now. Otherwise, I can send your question to Wolfram Alpha or to the Ohio Web Library. Both are good sources, but one may give you a better answer
depending on the nature of your question. If you're asking about statistics, economics, populations, or scientific data, I recommend <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank"><b>Wolfram Alpha</b></a>.
For other questions, I recommend the <a href="http://www.ohioweblibrary.org/" target="_blank"><b>Ohio Web Library</b></a>. Please enter "Wolfram" or "Ohio" now.
